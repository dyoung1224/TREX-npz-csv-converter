# TREX-npz-csv-converter
This repository contains Python scripts developed to convert .npz output files from the TREX animal tracking software into .csv files for downstream analysis of Daphnia motion data.

The code was developed as part of my Daphnia research at **CUNY Queens College**, conducted under the supervision of **Dr. Oleg Kogan** (Physics Department) and **Dr. Sebastian Alvarado** (Biology Department) in the Alvarado Lab. This research focuses on investigating the behavioral and phenotypic responses of Daphnia to environmental stimuli using motion tracking and computational analysis.

The script parses and extracts position and timestamp data for each tracked Daphnia, preserving the original temporal resolution. The resulting .csv files are formatted for direct use in motion analysis pipelines, including speed, displacement, and rotational bias analysis.
